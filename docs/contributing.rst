Contributing
************

Contributions of any sort are more than welcome,
so we hope this short introduction will help you to get started!
Shortly put: we use black_ to format our code, isort_ to sort our imports, pytest_ to test our code,
flake8_ to do its checks, and doc8_ for documentation checks.

See :ref:`devenv` for setting up a development environment,
and :ref:`new_devices` for some helpful tips for adding support for new devices.

.. _devenv:

Development environment
-----------------------

This section will shortly go through how to get you started with a working development environment.
We use `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`__ for managing the dependencies and packaging, so simply execute::

    poetry install

If you were not already inside a virtual environment during the install,
poetry will create one for you.
You can execute commands inside this environment by using ``poetry run <command>``,
or alternatively,
enter the virtual environment shell by executing ``poetry shell`` to avoid repeating ``poetry run``.

To verify the installation, you can launch tox_ to run all the checks::

    tox

In order to make feedback loops faster, we automate our code checks by using precommit_ hooks.
Therefore the first step after setting up the development environment is to install them::

    pre-commit install

You can always `execute the checks <#code-checks>`_ also without doing a commit.


.. _linting:

Code checks
~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of running all available checks during development,
it is also possible to execute only the code checks by calling.
This will execute the same checks that would be done automatically by precommit_ when you make a commit::

    tox -e lint


.. _tests:

Tests
~~~~~

We prefer to have tests for our code, so we use pytest_ you can also use by executing::

    pytest miio

When adding support for a new device or extending an already existing one,
please do not forget to create tests for your code.

Generating documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can compile the documentation and open it locally in your browser::

    sphinx-build docs/ generated_docs
    $BROWSER generated_docs/index.html

Replace `$BROWSER` with your preferred browser, if the environment variable is not set.


.. _new_devices:

Improving device support
------------------------

Whether adding support for a new device or improving an existing one,
the journey begins by finding out the commands used to control the device.
This usually involves capturing packet traces between the device and the official app,
and analyzing those packet traces afterwards.
The process is as follows:

1. Install Android emulator (`BlueStacks emulator <https://www.bluestacks.com>`_ has been reported to work on Windows).
2. Install the official Mi Home app in the emulator and set it up to use your device.
3. Install `WireShark <https://www.wireshark.org>`_ (or use ``tcpdump`` on Linux) to capture the device traffic.
4. Use the app to control the device and save the resulting PCAP file for later analyses.
5. :ref:`Obtain the device token<obtaining_tokens>` in order to decrypt the traffic.
6. Use ``devtools/parse_pcap.py`` script to parse the captured PCAP files.

::

    python devtools/parse_pcap.py <pcap file> --token <token>


.. _miot:

MiOT devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For MiOT devices it is possible to obtain the available commands from the cloud.
The git repository contains a script, ``devtools/miottemplate.py``, that allows both
downloading the description files and parsing them into more understandable form.


.. _checklist:

Development checklist
---------------------

1. All device classes are derived from either :class:`~miio.device.Device` (for MiIO)
   or :class:`~miio.miot_device.MiotDevice` (for MiOT) (:ref:`minimal_example`).
2. All commands and their arguments should be decorated with :meth:`@command <miio.click_common.command>` decorator,
   which will make them accessible to `miiocli` (:ref:`miiocli`).
3. All implementations must either include a model-keyed :obj:`~miio.device.Device._mappings` list (for MiOT),
   or define :obj:`~miio.device.Device._supported_models` variable in the class (for MiIO).
   listing the known models (as reported by :meth:`~miio.device.Device.info()`).
4. Status containers is derived from :class:`~miio.devicestatus.DeviceStatus` class and all properties should
   have type annotations for their return values. The information that can be displayed
   directly to users should be decorated using `@sensor` to make them discoverable (:ref:`status_containers`).
5. Add tests at least for the status container handling (:ref:`adding_tests`).
6. Updating documentation is generally not needed as the API documentation
   will be generated automatically.


.. _minimal_example:

Minimal example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. TODO::
    Add or link to an example.


.. _miiocli:

miiocli integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All user-exposed methods of the device class should be decorated with
:meth:`miio.click_common.command` to provide console interface.
The decorated methods will be exposed as click_ commands for the given module.
For example, the following definition:

.. code-block:: python

   @command(
       click.argument("string_argument", type=str),
       click.argument("int_argument", type=int, required=False)
   )
   def command(string_argument: str, int_argument: int):
       click.echo(f"Got {string_argument} and {int_argument}")

Produces a command ``miiocli example`` command requiring an argument
that is passed to the method as string, and an optional integer argument.


.. _status_containers:

Status containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The status container (returned by `status()` method of the device class)
is the main way for library users to access properties exposed by the device.
The status container should inherit :class:`~miio.devicestatus.DeviceStatus`.
This ensures a generic :meth:`__repr__` that is helpful for debugging,
and allows defining properties that are especially interesting for end users.

The properties can be decorated with :meth:`@sensor <miio.devicestatus.sensor>` decorator to
define meta information that enables introspection and programatic creation of user interface elements.
This will create :class:`~miio.descriptors.SensorDescriptor` objects that are accessible
using :meth:`~miio.device.Device.sensors`.

.. code-block:: python

    @property
    @sensor(name="Voltage", unit="V")
    def voltage(self) -> Optional[float]:
        """Return the voltage, if available."""
        pass


Note, that all keywords not defined in the descriptor class will be contained
inside :attr:`~miio.descriptors.SensorDescriptor.extras` variable.
This information can be used to pass information to the downstream users,
see the source of :class:`miio.powerstrip.PowerStripStatus` for example of how to pass
device class information to Home Assistant.
