History
-------
This project was started to allow controlling locally available Xiaomi
Vacuum cleaner robot with Python (hence the old name ``python-mirobo``),
however, thanks to contributors it has been extended to allow
controlling other Xiaomi devices using the same protocol `miIO protocol <https://github.com/OpenMiHome/mihome-binary-protocol>`__.
(`another source for vacuum-specific
documentation <https://github.com/marcelrv/XiaomiRobotVacuumProtocol>`__)

First and foremost thanks for the nice people over `ioBroker
forum <http://forum.iobroker.net/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=4898>`__ who
figured out the encryption to make this library possible.
Furthermore thanks goes to contributors of this project
who have helped to extend this to cover not only the vacuum cleaner.
